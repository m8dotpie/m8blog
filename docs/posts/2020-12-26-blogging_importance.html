        <p>Blogs like this are usually not personal diaries or something. The main point of such blogs writting some interesting or smart ideas and works to make them accessible by yourself and maybe by someone who is interested in discussed topic too.</p>
<p>Moreover, they show how your way of thinking and researching evolved during your career. (Doesnâ€™t matter if you are IT specialist or any other kind of specialist)</p>
<p>Well, it is only the first draft of a blog post and my blog at all, so will see if it makes any sense and somehow helps to work.</p>
