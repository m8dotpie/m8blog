<li><strong>Why Hakyll?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, I believe that one day I will write my own static site generator, but until that moment I have to use some tools written by other people. <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> made and configured with Haskell obviously. I thought that is a great chance to practice some Haskell; however, I changed default configuration very slightly.</p>

<li><strong>Why Courier New?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I understand that is difficult sometimes to ready long texts with this font. I wanted to use Roboto Mono as I always do, but I accidentally decided to try Courier New and really loved it from the very first character.</p>

<li><strong>How to replicate this design?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All the sources can be found <a href="https://github.com/m8dotpie/m8blog">here</a>.</p>
<p>What I have done to create this blog?</p>
<pre><code>- Generated Hakyll template site
- Changed navigation bar to responsive one (just copy-pasted from guide)
- Changed color of navigation bar to stylish black
- Polished some colors, margins, sizes and paddings
- Changed index.html to main blog list
- Made some modifications like &quot;important&quot; posts and etc</code></pre>
<p>The most difficult part was to make Hakyll work on Mac. One of packages relied on standard frameworks like Cocoa and etc; however, on MacOS 11 (Big Sure) there is a problem accessing them. So there is no way to use it with haskell stack package manager (unless you comment packages it canâ€™t compile). The only way is cabal package manager.</p>
