<h1 id="warning">Warning</h1>
<p>First of all, you must understand, that in further paragraphs information from <strong>wikipedia</strong>, different games and fandoms got mixed to create a bit more complete and interesting concept. There is no valid and anyhow proven theories, just some fairy tales.</p>
<h1 id="general-idea">General idea</h1>
<p><em>The term noosphere popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky">Vladimir Vernandsky</a></em></p>
<p>Noosphere is a new state of the biosphere. It represents the highest stage of biospheric development. It is highly tied with the idea of results of humankind knowledge and development. This philosophical concept was used and adapted in various games, fandoms and films. In general, modern concept of noosphere represents a layer around of the Earth, which consists of all the knowledge humankind has. Just like a biosphere, but a big data storage.</p>
<p>In simple terms, one of noosphere concepts says, that noosphere recieves all the knowledge and information humanking has and gives nothing, since people don’t know how to connect and get information from the noosphere (also called information field). The main reason discussed is simply another evolution way. Being connected to the noosphere means immediately getting any available to your kind information. This means to be a part of collective mind. Evolution made a bet on individualization of primates so we lost an ability to <strong>recieve</strong> information from the noosphere.</p>
<h1 id="scp-concept">SCP Concept</h1>
<p><strong>SCP Foundation Russian Branch fandom</strong> has a great article about the noosphere and new ideas around it. <a href="http://scpfoundation.net/scp-1373-ru">Link to the article</a>.</p>

Article TL;DR
</summary>
In this article a person connected to the noosphere can slightly change reality around him. Moreover, connection to noosphere is as high as person young. Therefore, Soviet Union uses children for this experiment. After few days of experimenting chindren start to predict cards and coin flips. (Not to predict, but to change the expected result, to be concrete, since they can slightly change the reality) But one evening they decided to call Bloody Mary and it led to the death of everybody in the camp.

<h1 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h1>
<p>In terms of computer programs accessing a part of memory, allocated for another program is the very common thing, it is just reading some bits from the unexpected location - invalid data pointers/etc, but if we try to abstract a bit more, we can consider this as the same thing as to take this data from the big information field - noosphere by definition, since we take this information from a big data storage, which contains all the knowledge computer programs on a given machine have. So any memory leakage in terms of a noosphere is a simple collective mind and connection to the global data and information field.</p>
<h1 id="the-matrix">The Matrix</h1>
<p>Finally let’s assume that we live in a simulation. It means that we all just a computer programs. Moreover, it means that our simulation has a big common for every program data storage. Yes, programs are isolated from each other, but general concept of noosphere is totally correct! All information we have, we store in common for everyone information field. But we simply cannot access restricted areas of memory and connect to collective mind. Or can we?</p>
