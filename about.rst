General
===========
My name is Igor Alentev. I was born in small capital of Adygea Republic called
Maykop. During my high school life I traveled a lot due to academic competitions
and contests in math and programming. Now I left my hometown to get Bachelor Degree
in Innopolis University.

Except for IT I really love mobile photography, travels, nature and dogs. It is 
really great when it is possible to combine all of my interests together. 
Also I'm very interested in
sport. During my High School I got degree of Sports Master of Russian Federation
in pneumatic pistol shooting exercise, but since then I have never done any sport
in a professional manner. Only some amateur cricket or football games, roller
skating or just skating.

In IT I have basic knowledge in a lot of different areas of
computer science, programming and engineering. (e.g. Data Science, DSA,
Quantum Computing, Desktop/Mobile/Wearable App Development, Low-level programming,
Computer Architecture, etc.)

However, I'm mostly interested in a close to hardware development as well as 
computer architecture and quantum computing with DSA (I use DSA as a short variant
for Data Structures and Algorithms). Huge experience in variuous math 
fields helps to properly understand underlying concepts and use them in favour of
performance, stability and reliability almost in any field.
