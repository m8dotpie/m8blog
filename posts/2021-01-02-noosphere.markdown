abstract: Let's assume for a second, that the whole world is a one big simulation. There are already enough ideas and theories around this topic. However, one thing still remains undiscussed...

# Warning
First of all, you must understand, that in further paragraphs information from
**wikipedia**, different games and fandoms got mixed to create a bit more complete
and interesting concept. There is no valid and anyhow proven theories, just
some fairy tales.

# General idea
*The term noosphere popularized by [Vladimir Vernandsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vernadsky)*

Noosphere is a new state of the biosphere. It represents the highest stage of
biospheric development. It is highly tied with the idea of results of humankind
knowledge and development. This philosophical concept was used and
adapted in various games, fandoms and films. In general, modern concept of
noosphere represents a layer around of the Earth, which consists of all the
knowledge humankind has. Just like a biosphere, but a big data storage.

In simple terms, one of noosphere concepts says, that noosphere recieves all
the knowledge and information humanking has and gives nothing, since people
don't know how to connect and get information from the noosphere (also called
information field). The main reason discussed is simply another evolution way.
Being connected to the noosphere means immediately getting any available 
to your kind information. This means to be a part of collective mind. 
Evolution made a bet on individualization of primates so we lost an ability
to **recieve** information from the noosphere. 

# SCP Concept
<strong>SCP Foundation Russian Branch fandom</strong> has a great article about the noosphere
and new ideas around it. [Link to the article](http://scpfoundation.net/scp-1373-ru).

<details>
    <summary>Article TL;DR</summary>
    In this article a person connected to the noosphere can slightly change
    reality around him. Moreover, connection to noosphere is as high as person young.
    Therefore, Soviet Union uses children for this experiment. After few days
    of experimenting chindren start to predict cards and coin flips. (Not to 
    predict, but to change the expected result, to be concrete, since they
    can slightly change the reality) But one evening they decided to call Bloody
    Mary and it led to the death of everybody in the camp.

# Computer Science
In terms of computer programs accessing a part of memory, allocated for another 
program is the very common thing, it is just reading some bits from the 
unexpected location - invalid data pointers/etc,
but if we try to abstract a bit more, we can consider this as the same thing as
to take this data from the big information field - noosphere by definition,
since we take this information from a big data storage, which contains all
the knowledge computer programs on a given machine have.
So any memory leakage in terms of a noosphere is a simple collective mind and 
connection to the global data and information field.

# The Matrix
Finally let's assume that we live in a simulation. It means that we all
just a computer programs. Moreover, it means that our simulation has a big
common for every program data storage. Yes, programs are isolated from each other,
but general concept of noosphere is totally correct! All information we have, 
we store in common for everyone information field. But we simply cannot access
restricted areas of memory and connect to collective mind. Or can we?
