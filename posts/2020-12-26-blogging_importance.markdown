Blogs like this are usually not personal diaries or something. The main point
of such blogs writting some interesting or smart ideas and works to make them
accessible by yourself and maybe by someone who is interested in 
discussed topic too.

Moreover, they show how your way of thinking and researching evolved during
your career. (Doesn't matter if you are IT specialist or any other kind of specialist)

Well, it is only the first draft of a blog post and my blog at all, so will see
if it makes any sense and somehow helps to work.
