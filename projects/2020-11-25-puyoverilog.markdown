title: Puyo Puyo Tetris Verilog Edition
abstract: It is not an individual project. I'm working in a team with my friend. There is no any builds or sources, since we are still on the stage of research and experiments. We want to make some unusual controls for this version, using different analog sensors to control the action. Publication expected.
